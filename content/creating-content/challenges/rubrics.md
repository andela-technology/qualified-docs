# Qualitative Rubrics
When developing your challenges, if you are planning to review the submitted candidate solutions in order to assess their quality, then you will want to define rubrics to aid your process. 

## Defining Content With A Rubric In Mind
Before we dive into the rubric functionality of Qualified, let's first talk about the importance of thinking about rubricsâ€”regardless if you decide to utilize rubric based scoring within your process. 

When reviewing the results of an assessment, and especially when looking over code solutions, it will be tempting to penalize a candidate for issues you see with their code. It is important to respect that if the goal of the challenge was not clear to the candidate, than it is possible to penalize someone for something they didn't think they would be assessed on. This is why it is important to think about how solutions will be judged on a qualitative level, even if the judgement process will only be using a subjective approve or reject rating process. It is also important that the areas in which judgement will be placed is made clear to candidates. 

For example, if you expect candidates to write production quality code, then candidates should be clearly instructed to write production quality code. Otherwise they may simply focus on completing tasks within the expected time, instead of making sure to save some time to ensure the quality is what it should be. Furthermore, you should have a good understanding about what "production quality code" should mean both to candidates and the expected learning outcome of the challenge. Do you want to leave the definition of production quality code vague, so that you can see how the candidate interprets the meaning? Or do you want to clarify the description because it could otherwise be too open ended or unclear for the given task, leading to inconsistent or potentially unfair results?

By thinking about how you expect solutions to be qualitatively assessed, and by making those expectations clear to your candidates, you will receive a more valid sample of their work. Even in cases of subjective judgement that does not involve an objectively defined rubric, this should help to improve consistency and validity in your overall assessment.        

## Objective Rubrics

Objective Rubrics are a feature which allow you to tailor structured rubric guides for each challenge, which allow your reviewers to quickly determine if candidates meet expectations or not. They provide guidance to reviewers on how they should rate the quality of a solution on an objective basis. Using rubrics, you can capture detailed information that can be used to build a competency profile for each candidate. This level of information allows you to identity key strengths and weaknesses. When combined with subjective ratings, which give reviewers freedom to express their concerns without a defined structure, you can continue to capture your team's approval sentiment while still retaining a structured process.

For recruiters, this allows you to hone in on areas that you should follow-up on within interviews. For educators this allows you to give structured feedback to candidates quickly and consistently, and for certification providers this allows you to certify qualitatively, not just quantitatively.

### Legacy Rubrics
Legacy rubrics within Qualified are simple "good", "neutral", and "bad" options for predefined categories, such as "Code Readability". These rubrics are enabled for all subscription types. Legacy rubrics cannot be customized per challenge, and do not provide any objective descriptions to help reviewers give objective opinions.

Legacy rubrics are being replaced by Qualified's new Signals based Objective Rubrics, which are currently in private beta.
