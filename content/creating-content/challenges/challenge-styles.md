# Challenge Styles

Coding challenges are often thought to be a certain type of style: Algorithmic Problems. These styles tend to focus heavily on the implementation of a well defined computer science algorithm. 

However Qualified was built to move away from these styles of challenges - which often don't match up well to type of work that will actually be done on the job. Regardless if you are using Qualified for education, certification or recruitment - the platform is always based on primarily assessing candidates through the use of work samples. Ultimately what aim's to learn is "can they do the work?". For this reason Qualified continues to explore more and more "styles" of challenges which can be used to target different aspects of a software engineer's job.


## Code Challenge Styles
The following styles are simply names we have given to different ways of utilizing the three challenge types on the Qualified platform to accomplish certain assessment outcomes with candidates.

Not all styles listed below are represented within the Qualified library. Qualified continues to experiment with and develop new styles of challenges to fit customer specific needs. Please reach out to us if you are interested in learning more.

This article is a work in progress. Many of the style descriptions listed will eventually be expanded to include more content, such as examples and recommended techniques.

### Foundational
A generalized coding task, mainly focused on testing basic ability to problem solve and write code. This will often involve writing a single function from scratch which performs some sort of utility function, or solves a simple problem that doesn't specifically involve a lot of CS theory. 

### Computer Science
Heavy focus on computer science and implementing algorithms and specific data structures.

### New Functionality
Real-world challenges that involve implementing new functionality within new or existing code.

### Refactoring
Existing code base that needs to be simplified, updated to make room for new improvements, or otherwise improved in some way. Unit tests can be used to ensure code still works as expected, with scoring being mostly done through objective rubrics.

### Debugging
Existing code base that needs to be fixed. Test cases can test that bug was fixed, but may still have a heavy reliance on manual reviews. This can be either a simple bug fix, or it can involve having to understand a lot of existing code before being able to understand how to make a change.

### Code Review
Existing code that only involves rubric scored written requirements for leaving review feedback.

### Design Review
Skeleton code is provided that gives a strong sense of the system design. Code is not necessarily functional, and not expected to be, but instead used as an interactive diagram and discussion point to contribute deep system analysis. Scoring is accomplished using objective reviews.


### UI Implementation
A design is provided, and a candidate must implement the design so that it becomes a working application. This could be a design from scratch, or an existing design that needs to be updated. Scoring can be done using a combination of unit tests and objective rubrics.

### Problem Solving
A challenge with a specific heavy emphasis on solving a problem, with clear evidence of critical thinking being required. This is a challenge that goes beyond the normal level of problem solving skills required just to be able to code something. i.e. Puzzles (non-real world challenges that target similar skills such as abstract problem solving, mathematical thinking and reasoning).

### Data Science 
Heavy focus on statistics, math, machine learning libraries and frameworks, data munging and reporting.

### Data Analysis
A challenge which asks a candidate to explore some data and to produce an analysis. This is an area where multiple challenges might be strong together (like a coding + q/a challenge set).

### Unit Test Construction
Existing code that needs tests written for it. Using project challenges, you can allow their tests to be used to actually score the challenge to give you a correctness score. However the score should be informative only, objective rubrics would be used to ultimately score the challenge.

### Tech Support
Instead of focusing on changing code, the challenge focuses on responding to a customer issue, troubleshooting what the issue may be, and reporting back to either management or the customer what the issue is. Objective rubrics would be used to score the challenge.

### Usability Testing
A front-end challenge is given where no coding is required. In fact its all hidden from the candidate, and the only thing you can do is view web preview to interact with the application. The task is to log any usability issues or bugs within a markdown file, as if they were creating Jira tickets. Would be objectively scored using rubrics.

## Q&A Challenge Styles
### Supplemental Knowledge
A set of questions designed to supplement a coding challenge, so that specific knowledge measurements can be used to provide more color to the profile. For example, after taking a React challenge, specific React knowledge NOT related to what was done in the challenge could be requested. The goal here is to broaden the knowledge surface. The candidate just wrote a React component that did XYZ, so what other type of React knowledge may be important to test on, that wasn't covered when doing XYZ?

### Research Study
This could be a research project, in a more traditional sense, or it could be something along the lines of deciding what options are available for implementing new functionality. i.e. Can a developer identify existing software (packages, libraries, apps, etc) available to them to implement a new set of functionality, or do they focus more on developing everything from scratch?

### Terminology
A series of vocabulary/terminology based questions which speak to the general awareness and understanding that a candidate has towards a particular subject. 

### Deductive Reasoning
A series of deductive reasoning questions, which are in the form of specifying statements/rules and determining which choices are accurate based off of those statements. This could also be in the form of reviewing code and indicating what a statement will do given certain parameters being passed in.

### Self Report
A set of question simply asking candidates to report on aspects of themselves. This could be used for scoring job fit, culture fit, or simply asking candidates to rate their own skills.
