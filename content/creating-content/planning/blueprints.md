# Assessment Blueprints

An assessment blueprint is a document which defines the plan for one or more assessments. The blueprint sets expectations and testing objectives. It defines the standards being measured, the relative importance of those standards and may specify the depth of knowledge expected for each item. Blueprints are useful tools for ensuring that assessments are aim to meet an expected standard of quality.

A robust assessment blueprint should:
- Determine the primary purpose of the assessment
- Identify the standards you will be assessing
- Identify the skills/competencies addressed within each standard
- Identify the levels of rigor of each skill
- Identify types of challenge styles to use for each skill.
