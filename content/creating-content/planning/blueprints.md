# Blueprint Thinking

An assessment blueprint is a document useful for defining the plan for one or more assessments. The blueprint sets expectations and expected testing objectives. It defines the standards being measured, the relative importance of those standards, and can even go into th depth of knowledge expected for each item. Blueprints come in different shapes and sizes. They are useful tools for ensuring that assessments are aiming to meet an expected standard of quality.

The core elements of a good blueprint include the following:
- Determining the primary purpose of the assessment.
- Identifying the standards you will be assessing on.
- Identifying the skills/competencies addressed within each standard.
- Identify the levels of rigor of each skill.
- Identifying possible types of challenge styles to use for each skill.
