# Assessment Planning: What is Involved? 
Depending on your needs, the assessment planning process could vary in how in-depth you go. For simple pre-screen recruiting use-cases, the process can be relatively quick. For deeper assessments used to evaluate job applicants, certify developers, or to test learnersâ€”the process can get more involved. 

The process of developing an assessment (or set of assessments) usually starts with identify the role the assessment is being built for. A job analysis is usually conducted to identify the job activities that are most relevant to be tested. We recommend anyone looking to craft their own assessment to start with a job analysis. We will cover that in more depth in our next article. 

The scope of the development process can span multiple phases, which include:

- Research
- Design & Construct Definition
- Implementation
- Pilot Testing
- Pilot Review & Scale Calculation
