# Job Analysis
When developing assessments which aim to assess a candidate's ability to perform for a specific job role, the best place to start is with a job analysis. This allows you to uncover the tasks that are most relevant to the job. From here, you can prioritize the tasks that can be best assessed and which fit into your target time limit. 

Qualified provides a tool for conducting an analysis. It should take about 10 minutes to complete and the process itself will allow you to understand your needs better. It also allows our team to work with you to select content which will best fit your needs.
