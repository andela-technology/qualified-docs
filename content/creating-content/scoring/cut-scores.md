# Cut Scores
When developing challenges and assessments, you want to use a criterion-referenced process. This means that you are selecting and creating content that tests a candidate's ability to perform as expected on a job-related task. Cut scores allow you to specify the minimum threshold that a candidate must achieve before they are considered to be able to perform the task at an acceptable level. 

Most challenges within Qualified's library are designed so that a 100% score must be achieved, but it is possible to configure challenges to be passing at a lower score. For example, maybe you instruct the candidate that there are some edge cases to think through, but don't call them out. Tests to score the required functionality are required, but others which only test edge cases are left as optional. These tests can help capture high vs average performers, without necessarily ruling average performers out from being able to perform the task.
