# Cut Scores
When developing challenges and assessments, we recommend using a criterion-referenced process. This means selecting and creating content that tests a candidate's ability to perform as expected on a job-related task. Cut scores allow you to specify the minimum threshold that a candidate must achieve before they are considered to be able to perform the task at an acceptable level. 

Most challenges within Qualified's library are designed so that a 100% score must be achieved to pass the challenge. However, it is possible to configure challenges to permit passing at a lower score. For example, a challenge might present a large number of bugs to fix with an idea that candidates are only expected to resolve a certain percentage within a given time span. These tests can help detect outstanding candidates without ruling average performers out entirely. Cut scores broaden the style of challenges that can be offered.
