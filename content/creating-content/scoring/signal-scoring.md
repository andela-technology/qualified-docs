# Competency Scoring via Signals

The Qualified platform takes an evidence-based approach to targeting specific competencies through the use of its Signals scoring system.  

The Signals system is based on the idea that aspects of an assessment can be used to measure candidate skills. Candidates who meet expectations on many critical skills are likely to be high performers. Signals are carefully selected to relate to the job role being assessed for, and can be targeted.

Using this system, it is possible to create as many sub-scores as you wish. These scores can be mapped to both autonomous and human-based scores and can be aggregated across challenges and assessments to create rich, competency-based profiles. 

:::important Limited Beta
