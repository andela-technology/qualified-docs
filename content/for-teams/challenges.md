# Challenges

Challenges are the individual tests that make up a larger assessment.  A challenge can be very simple, or very complex.

## Challenge Library

## Challenge Types

Qualified offers two types of code challenges, as well as question & answer challenges.

### Project Code Challenges

A project code challenge is an advanced programming challenge that allows for creating multiple solution files and build complex solutions within our web-based IDE. They also include real-time web previews, so are perfect for assessing front-end developers.

Unlike our normal code challenges, these can only be solved in the specific language for which they are designedâ€”however, they can provide a much deeper insight into the skills of your candidate.

### Classic Code Challenges

A classic code challenge is a programming test where the developer is given starting code and instructions, and expected to create a solution to meet the specified requirements. Each code challenge contains a set of tests that will be used to validate and score a developer's solution.

### Q&A Challenges

A Q&A challenge is one or more questions for the developer to answer. These questions can be multiple choice or free-text answers. Free-text answers can be long or short, and include markldown or code formatting.
