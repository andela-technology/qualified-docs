# Using Labels

As your add more Candidates, Assessments & Challenges to your team account, keeping everything straight may start to get unwieldy. This is where labels comes in. You can assign any label you wish to one or more of these record types. When viewing lists of these records, you can easily filter the by one or more of those labels.

## How Labels Work
Labels are tags which can be applied to your data. You do not need to predefine a label before apply it, you simply need to use whatever text value you want when applying a label. Later you can use list filters to filter by one or more labels.

## Managing Labels
For all three record types, labels can be managed by editing the given record. For candidates specifically, labels can also be applied when sending invitations or when bulk updating.

### Apply Labels via Invitations
When sending an invitation to one or more candidates, you can specify one or more labels to add. This is the most often used way of applying labels, as you will typically know the cohort when sending invitations.
 
:::tip Recommendation
We highly recommend you get into the process of utilizing labels when sending invites, as this practice will help you to keep your process organized from the start.

### Bulk Update
Candidates have the ability to be bulk edited, as well as to have actions taken on them. For example, you can bulk approve, bulk cancel invitations, or simply just bulk edit them. When taking any of these actions, you will have the option of adding or removing labels.  
 

## Challenge Topics
In additional to labels, which are supported in the Candidates, Assessments, and Challenges views - you can also apply topics to the challenges that you define. Topics work the same as labels, in that you can apply them to any record without having to predefine it. Their purpose is to provide a separate grouping of tag data which focuses on quickly identifying what the challenge aims to assess.

## Use-case Examples
Let's briefly go over some common usages for labels. These are examples, but feel free to use labels for whatever organizational purposes you may have.

### Candidates
#### Organize By Cohorts
If you are assessing candidates for hiring process, you could use labels to organize candidates by how they were sourced, or perhaps by which jobs they are applying to.

If you are assessing students in an educational setting, you could use labels to organize candidates by classroom. Cohort and classroom organization is discussed further in our [education article](../education). 

#### Organize by Process Stage     

For recruiting use-cases, labels are useful to organize candidates by which part of the process they are in. This is particularly useful if you are not using an ATS system, or simply have a multi-part assessment process which you want to track outside of the ATS, where as in the ATS you may simply treat the assessment process as a single stage.

### Assessments & Challenges
#### Organize By Target Cohort

If you are managing a large number of content to be used with different groups of candidates, we recommend that you organize the content by cohort. For example, job role, classroom, or seniority are all groupings that are commonly used.
