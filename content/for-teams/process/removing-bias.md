# Removing Bias From Your Process 

Teams wishing to implement unbiased evaluation practices can do so using a feature called Blind Reviewers. This is a special role which you can assign to team members. Once assigned this role, the team member shares a similar role to that of a normal "Reviewer", except that they will see no personally identifiable information about the candidate.

For instance, we only show them a codename for the candidates they review. This codename would be something like "Purple Turtle". Personal info such as name and email would be hidden. All other team members will have access to this codename so they can discuss the candidate freely without divulging identifiable information. When combined with our assessment reviews feature, team members can leave thorough ratings and feedback on the candidate's results without ever knowing who they are.

To enable this feature, simply invite or update an existing reviewer of the system with the Blinder Reviewer Role. 

## Reviewer Settings
There are a few team settings that you should be aware of when setting up your review process. 

- Do you want reviewers to see other reviews before leaving their own?
- Do you want blind reviewers to eventually see real names?

These settings can be configured within the team settings. We touched on this back when [going over the team settings](../team#assessment-reviews-visibility).
