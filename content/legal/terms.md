### Qualified Service
Qualified offers a Web Service to Customers that provides them technical skill assessments that they can send to Engineers to help determine their programming skills. The Web Service assists Customers in qualifying Engineers’ skill level with programming languages by providing them Assessments that test Engineers’ code and provides the Customer with an Assessment Report.

Qualified makes no warranties as to the efficacy of the service. Customers agree to provide only truthful and correct information for the purposes of enabling the service to work effectively. Similarly Customers understand that the service only effectively works if the Customers’ Engineer(s) complete and submit their Assessment(s), if they don’t Qualified will not have the necessary information to evaluate and provide a full Assessment Report. Customers realize that the Assessment Report is only as accurate as the Engineers’ correct and appropriate submission of the Assessment. Customers also agree that while they may use these skill assessments for evaluating Engineers’ programming skill, the evaluation and hiring of a Engineer is still entirely their responsibility, and they take full responsibility for any and all ensuing results.
