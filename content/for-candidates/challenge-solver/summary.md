# Challenge IDE

The code challenge solver provides an in-browser IDE for editing, testing, and running assessments.

## Quick Usage

- Enter the code for **Your Solution** in the code editor to the left.
- Click **SUBMIT SOLUTION** above to run your code against the assessment's tests.
    - Results will be shown in the lower right.
      _On smaller screens, this will appear as a tab alongside these instructions, rather than below._
- For some challenges, you may write your own tests in the editor labeled **Sample Tests (Modifiable)**.
    _On small screens, the Sample Tests editor appears as a tab beside the solution editor._
    - Click **RUN TESTS** to run code against the sample tests.
    - Results will be shown in the results pane as for solutions.
- Use **RESET** to reset your solution, your tests, or both.
- On some challenges, you can change the programming language.
- Add notes into the **Your Notes** section
- Use **NEXT CHALLENGE** to skip this challenge, or move to the next challenge once you've completed it.
