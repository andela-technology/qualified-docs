# Webhooks
:::important Premium Feature
Webhooks are only available on our custom plans.
:::

Webhooks make it easy to tie into events that occur in the Qualified system. You can configure them on the [integrations page](https://www.qualified.io/hire/account/integrations#webhooks).

![Webhooks URL config found within integrations page](/images/hire/webhooks.png)


## Setup

Want to be notified when a candidate starts and finishes their assessment? Interested in monitoring your own teamâ€™s development of challenges and assessments?

Simply provide a URL to your API and check the boxes for the events you want to be broadcasted to this URL. Then you can integrate into your own system actions to be taken upon completion of these events.

## Events

Either check the box to send all events, or choose from the list of webhook events to be notified of.


### Assessment Events

These methods are specific to updates concerning assessments so they emit a [Assessment](#assessment) in the `data` property.

- **Assessment Created** (assessment_created) - This event will fire when an assessment has been created.
- **Assessment Updated** (assessment_updated) - This event will fire when an assessment has been updated.
- **Assessment Published** (assessment_published) - This event will fire when an assessment has been published. At this point it will become available for candidate usage.
- **Assessment Destroyed** (assessment_destroyed) - This event will fire when an assessment has been deleted. This is a soft delete, so the assessment will in fact continue to exist should you need to reference it later.

### Assessment Result Events

These methods pertain specifically to a candidate's assessment outcome so they will emit an [Assessment Result](#assessment-result) in the `data` property.

- **Assessment Result Started** (assessment_result_started) - This event will fire when a candidate selects their language and begins their challenge on an assessment result.
- **Assessment Result Submitted** (assessment_result_submitted) - This event will fire when a candidate has completed their assessment and clicks submit. Once this has occurred, the candidate can no longer update the assessment result.
- **Assessment Result State Changed** (assessment_result_state_changed) - This event will fire when any of the following state changes occur on the assessment result: `invited`, `opened`, `started`, `submitting`, `submitted`, `terminated`. When using this event, you should not use `assessment_result_started` or `assessment_result_submitted` as it would be redundant.  

:::important Deprecation Notice
`team_candidate_started_assessment` and `team_candidate_submitted_assessment` events are deprecated. If you are currently using these events, please
update your integration to use `assessment_result_started` and `assessment_result_submitted`.
:::

These methods pertain specifically to a candidate's solution within an assessment so they will emit a [Solution](#solution) in the `data` property.

- **Solution Created** (solution_created) - This event will fire when a candidate starts to work on their solution for a challenge.
- **Solution Updated** (solution_updated) - This event will only fire when a candidate tests or submits their code solution. For Q&A solutions, this event will fire on all updates.
