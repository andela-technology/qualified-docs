## Setup
:::important
Qualified's Zapier integration is currently private, so you will not be able to find it within the public app directory.
::: 

The following steps must be taken to get setup with Zapier. 

1. Contact Qualified's sales team to request early access (if you do not already have it).
2. Visit the [integrations page](https://www.qualified.io/hire/account/integrations) and generate your new key.
3. Click the "Join Zapier Beta" button, which will open a new window to Zapier where you can accept the invite.
4. After the invite is accepted, you must setup a new connection to Zapier, using the key generated in step 2.
