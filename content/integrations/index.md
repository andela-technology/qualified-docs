# Integrating with Qualified

From pre-built integrations to comprehensive APIs and SDKs, Qualified is built to integrate into your process.

## Integrations for Educators 
For educators, check out our [LMS integrations page](lms) for more info about integrating with existing LMS solutions.

If you are looking to integrate Qualified into your own learning platform, embedding Qualified directly within it is possible using our [Embed SDK](integrations/custom-integrations/embed). You will also want to check out our [API](integrations/custom-integrations/api) and [Webhook](integrations/custom-integrations/webhooks) documentation for in-depth details on integrating platforms together.  

## Integrations for Recruiters
Qualified currently has integrations with the following HR systems:
 
### Applicant Tracking Systems

:::tip Don't see your ATS listed?
If your ATS system isn't supported by Qualified and you wish to send assessments through your ATS, we recommend that you set your assessment link to be public and then include it within an email template within your ATS system. We have provided an [example here](/for-teams/process/invitations/#email-template).
