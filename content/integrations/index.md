# Integrating with Qualified

From pre-built integrations to comprehensive APIs and SDKs, Qualified is built to integrate into your process.

## Integrations for Educators 
For educators, check out our [LMS integrations page](lms) for more info about integrating with existing LMS solutions.

If you are looking to integrate Qualified into your own learning platform, embedding Qualified directly within it is possible using our [Embed SDK](custom-integrations/embed). You will also want to check out our [API](custom-integrations/api) and [Webhook](custom-integrations/webhooks) documentation for in-depth details on integrating platforms together.
