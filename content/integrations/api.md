# API Access

If your subscription includes it, you can enable API-level control over your candidates & students, assessments, and more through the Qualified API. Once it's enabled, your account will have a unique access key associated with it.

> <i class="premium"></i> API Access is only available on our custom plans.

## Generating an API Key

On the API Access page you'll be able to generate a new API key if you don't have one
already or in case you believe your current API key could have been compromised. Once you
generate a new key, the old key is no longer valid. Keep it a secret!
