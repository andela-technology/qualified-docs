# Workable

Workable and Qualified have created an integration so that you can seamlessly use the two products together to add an assessment to your interview pipeline.

## Steps to Implement the Integration

### Setting up your API Key

First [retrieve your Qualified API Key](/integrations/api) which is used as your team's unique identifier through the integration. Do not share this key publicly.

### Creating a Qualified Assessment

To create a Qualified assessment you can either create one composed of challenges of your choice or you can use on of our assessment templates. Start by clicking the **CREATE AN ASSESSMENT** button on the assessments tab:
