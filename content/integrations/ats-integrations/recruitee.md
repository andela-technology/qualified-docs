# Recruitee

Recruitee and Qualified have created an integration so that you can seamlessly invite a candidate to take an assessment from Recruitee's platform. Receive scores and view assessment report directly on the candidate profile in Recruitee.

## Steps to Implement the Integration

### Setting up your API Key

First generate a new API key for your Recruitee integration on Qualified. Go to **Account Settings** > **Integrations** > **Recruitee** and generate a new API Key. Have this key handy or copy it to your clipboard.

Note: There's one API Key issued per Qualified team. As such, there's a one-to-one relationship between Qualified teams and Recruitee companies.


### Invite candidates to take Qualified assessments

Once you've enabled the Qualified integration for your organization, you can invite candidates on Recruitee to take Qualified assessments from their profile. 

You can scroll to the bottom of their profile and click on Send test button on the Qualified container. You can also click on the More button on the upper right corner of their profile and choose Send Qualified Assessments test from the drop down menu.

Either option will bring up a menu, where you can choose the candidate info to send and which of your organization's Qualified assessments to invite them to. Once you've made your choices, simply click the Send button.

To view their full results, you can click on the Open button on their results. You'll then be taken to the candidate's results page on Qualified.
