# Printing Tips

Some content in Qualified is designed to be printed for record keeping, and can be exported as a PDF via built-in functionality in your browser or operating system.

## Printing Dialog

When you go to print the content, you'll be shown an example of how the content will look. This example may differ from the final output, for example in how it spans multiple pages, but it should give you a good idea.

You may find that there are some options you can use to configure the output in this view as well.

## Enable Printing Backgrounds and Borders

When printing a document, make sure you enable printing of backgrounds, background images, and borders. This ensures you get all of the content on the page, including charts and diagrams.

Most of the content will be free of unnecessary background colors and images, to prevent wasting toner or ink.

### Chrome

In the Chrome print dialog, click on the **+ More Settings** option, then make sure that _Background graphics_ is checked.

You may also want to optimize the output by turning off _Headers and footers_ in this same section.

### Firefox

After selecting Print, there should be an option called **Appearance** with two checkboxes, _Print Background Colors_ and _Print Background Images_. Make sure both of these are checked.

You may also want to optimize the output by setting all of the **Page Headers** and **Page Footers** options to _--blank--_.

## Exporting to a PDF

If you wish to save the document as a PDF, you can use the built-in functionality in most browsers or operating systems.

### Chrome (any OS)

In the print dialog, look for the section called **Destination**, and click the button **Change…** there. Then choose _Save as PDF_ in the dialog.

Now simply click **Save** at the top, and you will have a ready-made PDF.

### MacOS (Any Browser)

When using the system dialog on MacOS, there's a button at the bottom-right that says **PDF**. Click this, and choose _Save as PDF…_.

### Windows 7, 8, or 10 (Any Browser)

In the print dialog on Windows 7, 8, or 10, change your printer to _Microsoft Print To PDF_, then print as normal.
