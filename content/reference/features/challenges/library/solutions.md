# Compare Challenge Solutions

All candidate and team-member solutions for a given challenge are shown with the ability to filter & sort them.

## Filtering

Along the left, you can filter solutions by various properties, including:

- **Score**, eliminating `0%` or only showing `100%` solutions
- **State of the assessment**, such as _Published_ or _Started_
- **Hide Team Members**, to only show actual candidate results
- **Languages**, to filter for a specific language for that solution

## Solution Details

Besides the code for each solution, you can also see:
- The language used
- The score for that solution
- The state of the assessment

Along the right you'll find additional details, including:

- Scoring and timing data
- Links to the candidate & assessment result
- Feedback from the candidate (if any)
- The ability to load the candidate's results in if you want to see them

## Restricting to Assessment

If you come to this page from a specific Assessment, the solutions will be limited to that assessment result, and you'll also be able to quickly switch between challenges on that assessment.
