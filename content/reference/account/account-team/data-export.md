# Data Export

Included with some subscriptions, Data Export makes it easy to export a summary of your data as [a CSV file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). This format can easily be opened in most spreadsheet programs, enabling you to perform more detailed analysis outside the Qualified app.

We currently provide the following three types of data export:

> <i class="premium"></i> Data Exporting is only available on our custom plans.

## Candidates / Students

A list of developers who have used Qualified with your team. Includes basic information about the developers such as their name, email, state and various event timestamps.

If you have a lot of candidates, you can filter the list to a specific Assessment.

## Assessment Results

A list of all assessment results for your team. Includes some basic information about the developer, the assessment name, score, current state and more.

If you have a lot of candidates, you can filter the list to a specific Assessment. If you don't filter the export and you have candidates take multiple assessments, you will see them in the list more than once.

## Assessment Summaries

A list of each of your assessments with summarized result counts.

You can limit this list to assessments of a specific status if you would like.
