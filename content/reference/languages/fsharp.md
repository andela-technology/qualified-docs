## Environment

Qualified supports F# 6.0 (tested with NUnit) and F# 4.0 with Mono 4.8 (tested with Fuchu).

F# 4.0 is [deprecated](/creating-content/challenges/upgrading-language-versions/#deprecation-process). Use F# 6.0.

## Timeout

The sandbox environment will timeout the code within 12 seconds.

## Testing

Our F# environment supports the following testing frameworks:

- [fsharp/nunit](/reference/languages/fsharp/nunit) (F# 6.0 only)
- [fsharp/fuchu](/reference/languages/fsharp/fuchu) (F# 4.0 only)
