# Solidity

## Environment

Qualified supports Solidity version 0.8.16.

The environment includes [`@openzeppelin/contracts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openzeppelin/contracts) which offers a collection of smart contracts. You can import a contract with `import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol"`, for example.

## Testing

Our Solidity Hardhat environment supports testing through the [Mocha](/reference/languages/solidity/mocha) library.
