# C++

## Environment

Qualified supports C++17 with Clang 8 and C++14 with Clang 3.8.

C++14 is [deprecated](/creating-content/challenges/upgrading-language-versions/#deprecation-process). Use C++17.

## Timeout

The sandbox environment will timeout the code within 12 seconds.

## Testing

Our C++ environment supports the following testing frameworks:

- [cpp/gtest](/reference/languages/cpp/gtest).
- [cpp/igloo](/reference/languages/cpp/igloo).

Google Test is only supported when C++17 with Clang 8 is used.
