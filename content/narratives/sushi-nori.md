# SushiNori Restaurant Narrative
SushiNori is a fictitious restaurant which is the motivating story behind a number of our challenges and assessments. This article offers context for the SushiNori concept to familiarize candidates with its business model and the types of programming questions that it has inspired.

## Background and Business Model
Imagine you are working for a custom software development shop. That shop has been hired by SushiNori to develop software around the unique aspects of their business. You are one of the developers on the team that will be building the software. Through our challenges, you’ll assist them in building a custom ordering system, report on their sales and staff using database queries, and optimize operations concerns.

SushiNori’s business model revolves around offering delicious sushi hand-rolls to its customers, who sit at a large bar with sushi chefs in the middle. There are no other seats in this restaurant, just the U-shaped bar, as shown in this seating chart:

Customers (seated in groups) can pick from a number of sushi rolls on the menu à la carte and will generally order multiple items, which are served in a round-robin manner.

Up to two chefs are on duty at a given time, and many of the challenges involve scheduling these chefs for shifts and implementing functions that delegate orders between the chefs according to SushiNori’s business rules.

## Database
Developers may be asked to work on one or more database challenges. SushiNori’s database involves queries written on a minimal set of typical order-based tables. For example, some queries will involve reporting on recent sales using simple tables such as the following:

## General Challenge Info
Much of the data passed between modules in the SushiNori codebase involve simple JSON or similar object structures. Processing and managing these structures is a prominent task in tackling SushiNori challenges.

These challenges range in difficulty and exercise a variety of general and specialized programming, planning and design skills such as writing adaptable, reusable code; object-oriented design; algorithms and data structures; requirements comprehension; refactoring; and crafting database queries.
