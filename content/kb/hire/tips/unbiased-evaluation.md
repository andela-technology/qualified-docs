# Unbiased Hiring & Blind Reviews

Teams wishing to implement unbiased hiring and evaluation practices can do so within our product using a feature called "Blind Reviewers". This is a special role which you can assign team members. Once assigned this role, the team member shares a similar role to that of a normal "Reviewer", except that they will see no personally identifiable information about the candidate.

For instance, we only show them a codename for the candidates they review. This codename would be something like "Purple Turtle". Personal info such as name and email would be hidden. All other team members will have access to this codename so they can discuss the candidate freely without divulging identifiable information. When combined with our assessment reviews feature, team members can leave thorough feedback on the candidate's results without ever knowing who they are.

To enable this feature, simply invite or update an existing reviewer of the system with the Blind Reviewer Role.
