# Setup Guide

On this page you will find several steps to assist you in quickly getting started using Qualified.

## Set Up an Assessment (or Coding Session)

This section lets you create your first assessment, either by selecting one from our existing library, or creating one from scratch.

If you've signed up for our Interact Sessions feature, you'll also be given an option to select the blank Whiteboard Assessment to get started even faster.

As with many of the setup steps, you can also opt to invite another team member to help you with this step.

## Take Your New Assessment

Once you've selected your assessment, we recommend running through it on your own, or having another technical team member run through the assessment.

Taking the assessment will ensure that it is a good fit for your team, and help you understand what will be expected of the candidate or student. If you an get at least 3 team members to take the assessment, it will also help you get a good baseline score in for comparison with our detailed statistics.

At this point, you have an assessment that you are ready to use. This section will guide you through inviting one or more candidates or students to begin.

Clicking the _Invite on or more candidates/students_ button to open the candidate/student invitation dialog. Here you can enter multiple emails, add an optional custom message, and send off the invitation.

The developers will receive an email giving them a link to jump right into the assessment. As soon as they start, you'll be able to see their ongoing results from under the Candidates/Students section of the app.
