# Markdown

Qualified uses a slightly customized form of Github-Flavored Markdown for editing challenge instructions.

You can learn more about using [Markdown here](/kb/general/markdown).

## Multi-Language Support

In addition to GFM, which already provides support for [fenced code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code), we also support providing examples in multiple languages. Simply stack fenced code blocks back to back. The languages that are not relevant to the context will be filtered out. You can use the language tabs at the top of the preview pane to set the language display context.

# Tips

- We highly recommend that you provide language examples within the description to help clarify how the expected code might be used.
- Fun back stories to the challenge can make things interesting, but try not to lean in to the story so much that the requirements get lost. Remember that the candidate or student is taking a test - they are likely already stressed by the idea of being graded as it is, so try to make their task as transparent as possible.
