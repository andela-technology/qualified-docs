# Q&A Challenges

Q&A challenges are great for gaining insight into your candidate beyond pure coding techniques. You can use them to learn more about the candidate's personality, test their abstract knowledge, or even test their technical knowledge with timed questions.

## Q&A Challenge Details

When viewing Q&A challenges, you'll be able to view the questions and answers or validation for the entire quiz. You'll also be able to see how questions and answers are weighted for the final score.

# Solving Q&A Challenges

The workflow for solving a Q&A challenge depends on whether it is untimed, quiz-timed, or per-question-timed.

## Untimed

1. All questions are presented to the candidate up-front.
2. The candidate can enter answers, either with the mouse or by using keyboard shortcuts (shown alongside answers).
3. After answering each question, the candidate can use <span class="shortcut-hint"><span class="mac-os-only" title="Command">&#8984;</span><span class="not-mac-os-only">CTRL</span> + ENTER</span> to move to the next question.
4. The candidate is free to move forward and backward through the questions until they are satisfied with their answers (or the entire assessment time limit runs out, if set).

## Q&A-Timed

1. The challenge timer is shown at the top of the screen, and all questions are presented to the candidate at once.
2. The candidate can enter answers, either with the mouse or by using keyboard shortcuts (shown alongside answers).
3. After answering each question, the candidate can use <span class="shortcut-hint"><span class="mac-os-only" title="Command">&#8984;</span><span class="not-mac-os-only">CTRL</span> + ENTER</span> to move to the next question.
4. The candidate is free to move forward and backward through the questions until the challenge timer runs out.

## Per-Question Timed

1. The candidate is shown a single question, along with a question timer at the top of the screen.
2. The candidate can enter the answer for the visible question, either with the mouse or by using keyboard shortcuts (shown alongside answers).
3. After answering each question, the candidate can use <span class="shortcut-hint"><span class="mac-os-only" title="Command">&#8984;</span><span class="not-mac-os-only">CTRL</span> + ENTER</span> to move to the next question.
    - If the candidate takes too long to answer a specific question, the question is locked and they must press <span class="shortcut-hint"><span class="mac-os-only" title="Command">&#8984;</span><span class="not-mac-os-only">CTRL</span> + ENTER</span> to move to the next question.
    - Pausing between questions **is** allowed, and the only penalty would be if there is an assessment-level time limit.

## Q&A Challenge Preview UI

You can open the solver for Q&A challenges either by previewing an entire assessment, or using the **PREVIEW** button on a challenge.

This solver gives you the ability to test answering questions and previewing autoscore results.

<div class="note-box">
Within the preview window, nothing is saved, this is purely a way to quickly view how a challenge works.
</div>

# Creating Q&A Challenges

You can create a challenge by using the **CREATE A CHALLENGE** menu in the Challenges sidebar, or you can use the **EDIT** or **DUPLICATE** buttons to modify an existing one.

## Previewing

You can preview a challenge before saving by using the **PREVIEW** button, or pressing <span class="shortcut-hint"><span class="mac-os-only" title="Command">&#8984;</span><span class="not-mac-os-only">CTRL</span> + P</span>. This will let you see how the challenge works as a candidate, including previewing scoring results. Pressing <span class="shortcut-hint"><span class="mac-os-only" title="Command">&#8984;</span><span class="not-mac-os-only">CTRL</span> + P</span> again will return you to the editor. 

## Saving & Publishing

Once you are comfortable with the challenge you have entered, you can choose to **SAVE & PUBLISH** the challenge immediately. If you aren't ready to exit the editor, you can use the **Save Changes** option under the save button menu.

If you don't want to publish the challenge, you can keep it in the _Draft_ state by using **Save Draft** under the save button menu.
