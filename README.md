## Documentation

### Content Structure

The `/content` folder contains all markdown articles used within these docs. Each directory represents a level of depth. Up to 3 levels of depth are shown within the applications sidebar. The 2nd level of depth is treated only as a section header, so the only information the `/content/[depth 1 folder]/[depth 2 folder]/index.html` file should contain is `title` and `order` front-matter.
